This is a tool for creating .mod files to help with loading script modules into Maya. I primarily made it to practice creating files with Python.

To install this script, place its folder in your Maya/scripts folder and then create a shelf button using the code from moduleLoaderINSTALL.py.
Pressing the button should open the Module Loader window. From there, simply follow the instructions in the text fields and once the window is filled in press, "Install Module!!".
Confirm that it worked by looking in your Maya version folder for a "modules" folder with a .mod file pointing to the folder with your module in it.
