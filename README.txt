This is a tool for creating .mod files to help with loading script modules into Maya. I primarily made it to practice creating files with Python.

INSTALLATION:
- Save the folder this file is in to your maya/scripts directory.
- Drag and drop moduleLoader_INSTALL.py into your Maya viewport.
- A button should be created in your "custom" shelf.

Once the tool is open, follow the instructions in the text fields and once the window is filled in press, "Install Module!!".
Confirm that it worked by looking in your Maya version folder (ex.2025) for a "modules" folder with a .mod file pointing to the folder with your module in it.
